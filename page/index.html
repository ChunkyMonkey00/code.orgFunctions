      <p><a href="https://github.com/ChunkyMonkey00/code.orgFunctions">Code.org JS Library</a> is a pure javascript library made 100% in pure javascript by <a href="https://github.com/ChunkyMonkey00?scrlybrkr=8dc0c9ce">ChunkyMonkey00</a> on github.
      The idea is to provide previous app lab and game lab users a way to transition from code.org's functions, 
      as pure javascript does not have those functions built in. While some functions do not
      operate the exact same way, or have different names, the idea and majority of functions are 
      exactly the same. This library is Open-Source so use and modification of it is completely
      legal and actually encourages, as long as the original repo and source code are left untouched.
      </p>
      <p>
        The current aim of this library is only for support from the built-in App Lab and Game Lab
        on code.org, and you might find some sections are mostly missing. These sections (unless specified otherwise)
        are likely to never be implemented in the sourc-code due to lack of capability, lack of necessity, or simple
        lack of function. To check the current status and updates, visit the github repo (first link on page)
        and check the changelog.log file.
      </p>
      <p>From the developer personally, i hope you have fun and find use in this library. Documentation can be found
        ond the Documents page. ENJOY :)
